# DECISION MAKING APP

The goal of this app is to aid in the decision making process by assigning a user defined numeric value to each of the pros and cons entered, making a calculation based on that data and returning a result to the user (the percentage one decision is better than the other).  

## Use the App:
- Visit [HERE](https://brentgrammer.github.io/Decision-Making-App/) to use the application.

### FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:

- Add button type = "reset" to reset slider values and form
- Fix Infinity% bug when one slider for one decision is raised from default value
- Style the UI
- Adjust width of sliders so they do not go outside of the borders
- make the math and formula for calculating the percent better value consistent (currently negative results yield a percentage based on the higher positive sum as a divisor, and results that are both positive or contain a 0 are based on a divisor related to the lower result of the two.)
