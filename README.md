DECISION MAKING APP

The goal of this app is to aid in the decision making process by assigning a user defined numeric value to each of the pros and cons entered, making a calculation based on that data and returning a result to the user (the percentage one decision is better than the other).  

TASKS TO COMPLETE:

- Add button type = "reset" to reset slider values and form
- Fix Infinity% bug when one slider for one decision is raised from default value
- Style the UI 
- Adjust width of sliders so they do not go outside of the borders
