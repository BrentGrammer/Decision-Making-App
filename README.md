# DECISION MAKING APP

The goal of this app is to aid in the decision making process by assigning a user defined numeric value to each of the pros and cons entered, making a calculation based on that data and returning a result to the user (the percentage one decision is better than the other).  

TASKS TO COMPLETE:

- Add button type = "reset" to reset slider values and form
- Fix Infinity% bug when one slider for one decision is raised from default value
- Style the UI
- Adjust width of sliders so they do not go outside of the borders
- make the math and formula for calculating the percent better value consistent (currently negative results yield a percentage based on the higher positive sum as a divisor, and results that are both positive or contain a 0 are based on a divisor related to the lower result of the two.)

COMPLETED TASKS:

- Deployed on AWS
- Fixed Infinity% bug when the divisor result is equal to 0.
- Added a reset button to reset the slider values and clear the pros and cons.
